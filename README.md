# Transfer-Learning

This model is a CNN based only on the character level as charCNN [1]. It exploit the benefit of deep structure for text understanding task as [3]. The first work of transfer a shallow CNN & distant supervision can be read at [5]. The aim of this model is to transfer a very deep (rather than a shallow) network and base only on character level without any feature-engineering at the word level [5].

The code is rewritten under Tensorflow TF-Slim to be shorter and facilitate more easily the tranfer of deep networks' layers, as Inception-v3 [4]. 

The evaluation is on small data set of Semval-2013 (2.3k/0.9k pos/neg tweets). The input is a big Twitter's emoticon data set (1.6 M balanced pos/neg tweets) [6]
